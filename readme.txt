== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the minimum PHP requirement? =
For the plugin itself, PHP4 is enough. But, PHPingFm class needed PHP5 to run properly. Conclusion? PHP5!

= Why don't you use / create a library that support PHP4  =
Why should I reinvent the whell? It's you or your hosting server that needed an upgrade. PHP4 is dead, move along.

= I can post to WP without problems but I am not seeing the update come into Pingfm? =
First, make sure you fill in the correct [Application Key](http://ping.fm/key/ "Ping.fm Application Key"). Then, set the mode to: For all categories (*all*)

= I still don't see any update come to Pingfm  =
Maybe there's something wrong with your server configurations. Note: You need PHP5 and CURL library to make it working properly.
