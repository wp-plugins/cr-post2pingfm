== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the minimum PHP requirement? =
Untested on PHP4. I develop it using PHP 5.3

First, make sure you fill in the correct [User Key](http://hellotxt.com/ "HelloTXT User Key"). Then, set the mode to: For all categories (*all*)

= I still don't see any update come to Pingfm  =
Maybe there's something wrong with your server configurations. Note: You need PHP5 and CURL library to make it working properly.
